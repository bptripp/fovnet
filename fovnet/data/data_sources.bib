abstract = {The projection from the retina to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in the primate arises from two morphologically distinct types of ganglion cells. The P-ganglion cells project to the parvocellular layers, the M-ganglion cells to the magnocellular layers. We have developed a neurofibrillar stain which stains the M-ganglion cell population with a high degree of selectivity allowing us to map their distribution across the retina. As with other ganglion cell types the M-ganglion cell density peaks close to the fovea and declines towards the periphery. At 1 mm from the fovea the proportion of M-ganglion cells ranges from 6 to 10{\%} and then increases to about 8-10{\%} over much of the retina except along the nasal horizontal meridian. Along the nasal horizontal meridian the percentage increases from 10{\%} at 7 mm eccentricity to 20{\%} or more at higher eccentricities. The increased percentage of M-ganglion cells in the nasal quadrant of the retina correlates with the relatively smaller dendritic trees of M-ganglion cells in this region.},

abstract = {We studied the receptive field organization and contrast sensitivity of ganglion cells located within the central 80 (radius of 40) deg of the macaque retina. Ganglion cell activity was monitored as synaptic (S) potentials recorded extracellularly in the lateral geniculate nuclei of anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. Receptive field center and surround regions of magnocellularly-projecting (M) and parvocellularly-projecting (P) cells increase in area with distance from the fovea, with the center radii of M cells being about twice those of neighboring P cells. Peak sensitivities of center and surround regions are inversely proportional to the regions' areas, so that integrated contrast sensitivities (contrast gains) are constant across the visual field, with the gain of M cells being, on average, six times that of P cells. For both M and P cells, the average ratio of surround/center gain is 0.55. Constant gain of P cells across the visual field is achieved by increasing sensitivity to stimuli falling on the peripheral retina to an extent that counteracts the aberrations introduced by the eye's optics.},

@article{Perry1984,
abstract = {Horseradish peroxidase was deposited in the optic nerve to retrogradely label and reveal the dendritic form of all classes of ganglion cell, or it was injected into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to reveal only those classes projecting to the thalamus. The results were compared with those of the accompanying paper in which the ganglion cells projecting to the midbrain are selectively revealed. Two major classes of ganglion cells are described, the P$\alpha$ and P$\beta$ cells. For both classes dendritic field size increases with eccentricity from the fovea and there is no overlap in the two classes at any given eccentricity. Cell body size shows a similar mean difference but with a slight overlap. Both cell bodies and dendritic fields are larger along the temporal horizontal meridian than the nasal horizontal meridian, for P$\alpha$ and for P$\beta$ cells, but these differences are reduced when naso-temporal differences in ganglion cell density are taken into account, that is, size correlates closely with density. Injections restricted to the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus labelled almost exclusively P$\beta$ cells, whereas injections confined to the magnocellular layers labelled almost exclusively P$\alpha$ cells. As midbrain injections label no P$\beta$ cells and few P$\alpha$ cells it can be shown that about 80{\%} of ganglion cells are P$\beta$ cells projecting to parvocellular lateral geniculate nucleus, and that about 10{\%} are P$\alpha$ cells projecting to magnocellular layers. The coverage factor, that is the number of cells covering each point on the retina, varied from 1.9-2.3 for P$\beta$ cells, and from 2-7 for P$\alpha$ cells. Comparing the results with those of comparable investigations on cats and rabbits shows a much clearer segregation of the terminal targets of different classes of ganglion cell in monkeys, the greatest difference being the absence in the monkey of a projection to the geniculate from gamma- and epsilon-like cells. Further, axons which branch and innervate both thalamus and midbrain are rare in monkeys but common in other mammals. Comparing the results with those from physiological investigations suggests that the P$\beta$ cells correspond to colour-opponent cells, whereas P$\alpha$ cells correspond to the achromatic broad-band magnocellular cells. {\textcopyright} 1984.},
